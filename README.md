# MultiLayer-Perceptron-Neural-Network
Implementation a 2 layer neural network with ReLU and softmax function on MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. Each datapoint contains 784 input features – the pixel values from a 28 × 28 image – and belongs to one of 10 output classes – represented by the numbers 0-9).
